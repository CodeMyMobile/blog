One of the main reasons you'd want to get an app developed like TikTok is maybe that it's getting banned from major countries because of its security issues. It has already been banned in India and talks are going on in the USA and Brasil regarding its ban.



If you already didn't know, let us introduce you, it is a music video platform where users create a small music video using the app and share it to the world just like one shares their pictures on Instagram. It was earlier called Vine, then it was converted to Musical.ly and then finally it was renamed into TikTok by its ownership Chinese based company ByteDance.

### What does TikTok do?

The app brings in songs and tunes which is currently popular on the internet. The users get to lip-sync, dance to songs, add effects, add filters and do all sorts of acts to make their video have more view count. At first, TikTok videos could only be up to 15 seconds long, but the company recently extended the limit to 60 seconds when you string 4 15-second segments together.

##### Some of the main features which made the app popular are:

* Amazing effects and filters
* Latest music
* High-speed image capture
* Sharing videos facility



After reading all this, we're sure that by now you might be pretty curious about the development cost of apps similar to that of TikTok. Using this blog you'll get an approx idea about getting an app developed similar to it. Given all this, it's true that the cost can still fluctuate based on the mobile app development platform which you choose for your project as well as on the functionalities that you plan to add up in the app.

### “Must-have” features for your mobile app like TikTok

* Login screen: Like every other app, this feature is a must. This section will not be an issue for the users.
* UX, UI and App Navigation: Nothing can beat a good user experience, after all, it says in its name - Good - User - Experience. Everyone wants a good experience. Most apps fail not because they lack in the service they provide, but because they fail to provide a good experience, a simple interface and consist of very troublesome app navigation.
* Likes and comments: Social media is all about flexing. The hearts are the measure of popularity for the videos. The more number of hearts you get, the more popular you will be and your videos. Same is the case with commenting.
* Filters and effects: Now, this is something where TikTok stands out when compared to others. The app consists of some top-notch effects which are usually available only on professional video editing software. Some of the special features which make videos more interactive are slow-mo, reverse, zoom, glitch and flash.
* Sharing: Without sharing there won't be any social media, same is the case with TikTok. Logically, there is just no meaning to coming up with an amazing video build with all your effort just to know that you cannot share it.
* Upload video and sound: It would be very obvious that there might be certain songs or effects that won't be available on the app (copyright issues, not famous enough etc.). To tackle this, TikTok allows users to upload pre-made songs and videos.
* Notifications: The users can know about the latest likes, tags, and followers by checking out the real-time notifications.
* Settings: This allows several things like editing your profile, managing notifications, restricting accounts, changing password, etc.
