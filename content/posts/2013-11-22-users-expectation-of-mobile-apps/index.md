# What Users Expect from a Mobile App!

Users expect mobile apps to work quickly and easily. Regardless of how well designed a mobile app is,  it can fail in the marketplace if the functionality is not user friendly. 58% of issues reported by customers are UI related, making it the most frequent issue reported by app users. Speed is even more important for mobile apps than it is for websites on desktops. 59% of the users deletes the app due to slow responsiveness.

Apart from this, too many choices and distractions while accessing a feature may make a user to give up as 53% of the users stop using an app due to too many distractions.

An important consideration is Touch Target, even if you have a clear and efficient path for navigating through the features, an incorrect touch target may hinder the users in selecting the appropriate buttons. To ensure this never happens, a smartphoneâ€™s touch target should ideally span 48dp.

The potential users are most influenced by what the existing users are saying about the apps.92% of consumers say the average star rating on an online store for a mobile app influences their decision to download and only 15% would consider downloading a 2 star rated app.

Key Takeaways:

* UX can make or break your idea.
* People while on an app expect it to perform faster than a website.
* Existing users reviews forms a very important  consideration for potential users.
