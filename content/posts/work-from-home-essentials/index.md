WORK FROM HOME ESSENTIALS

Ah, offices, who doesn't miss their office? Wait, do people really miss their office? You got to be kidding us. Why would someone miss their office?

Understandably, your work is the main source of your daily bread and butter and this time isolation might get a little scary for many. Agreeing to the fact that things may be a bit hard, but they're not impossible, right? For most of the service based industry work from home is a possibility.

We have sorted the functionality and needs of several departments and how you can manage your responsibilities while working remotely.

We recommend you to go through everything because there are several awesome tools mentioned throughout the blog which might come handy to you regardless of your profile.

## CEO (Chief Executive Officer)

Can also be known as the head of the company. Being a CEO is not easy. They've got an entire company to run and are the role model of all the employees. They have to stay tough in a hard time like these so that the morale of everyone stays high. It's well said somewhere 'with great powers comes great responsibilities'. Some of the main tasks of the CEO are

### 1. Staying in Touch:

Communication is the key, whether it's with the clients or with the team. A CEO has to look all around throughout his company to make sure the work is running efficiently without any hindrances. They also have to resolve major client issues. Some of the tools they can use are:

#### 1.a Staying in Touch with Team:

* [Trello](https://trello.com/): Trello lets you work more collaboratively and get more done. You can check on to your team's work progress and can alter any changes you'd like to see. Whether it’s for work, a side project or even the next family vacation, Trello helps your team stay organized. Also, you can dive into the details by adding comments, attachments, due dates, and more directly to Trello cards. Collaborate on projects from beginning to end.

Price: Free

* [Zoom](https://zoom.us): Zoom is one of the most popular free software applications worldwide. It is used for telecommuting, distance education, and social relations. Analysts claim that it is more reliable and easier to use than competitors. Zoom has received many awards. This is an important tool especially for remotely working teams where face to face meetings are just not possible most of the time.

Price: Use of the platform is free for video conferences of up to 100 participants, with a 40-minute time limit. For longer or larger conferences with more features, paid subscriptions are available, costing $15-20 per month.

* [Slack](https://slack.com): Think of Slack as your messaging app or WhatsApp and combine it with your official email, and now multiply its functionality by 10. The company claims "You could get buried in email. Or you could get real work done in Slack." and we can't agree anymore.

1. Why Slack over email? In your inbox, seeing all the conversations about a single project requires sifting through many different email chains. In Slack, you’ll save time by seeing all the discussions and files about a project in one place: a channel. Also, Slack gives you access to real-time conversations with any teammate or team. Unlike email, where every new message is weighted alike, it’s easy to grab a specific someone's attention with a notification when you need a quick response.
2. Why Slack over messaging apps? These have limited functionality with other apps — Slack connects with all of your work tools, so you can find information or perform quick actions without leaving conversations.

Price: Free to $12.50/month

#### 1.b Staying in Touch with Clients:

* [Skype](https://skype.com): Zoom could be used for this purpose as well, but since it is a relatively new company, there are chances your clients might not be using it. Thus, Skype. The old school video calling app which is still running smooth and flawlessly. It specializes in providing video chat and voice calls between computers, tablets, mobile devices, the Xbox One console, and smartwatches over the Internet. Skype also provides instant messaging services. Users may transmit text, video, audio and images. Skype allows video conference calls. Skype today is used by 100 million people on a monthly basis and 40 million people use it daily. Skype-to-Skype calls are free of charge, while calls to landline telephones and mobile phones are charged.

Price: Freemium

* Google [Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about): Presentations are an important part of the meetings. A lot more can be explained via a presentation than a normal video call. According to the studies, a presentation has more than double chances to claim a client then a simple audio or video call. And when we're talking about presentations, we can't think of anything else than Google Slides.

Google Slides is available as a web application, mobile app for Android, iOS, Windows, BlackBerry, and as a desktop application on Google's ChromeOS. The app is compatible with Microsoft PowerPoint file formats. Slides allow users to create and edit presentations online while collaborating with other users in real-time. Edits are tracked by the user with a revision history that tracks changes to the presentation.

Not just that, many free interactive aesthetically pleasing templates are available for users to kick start their projects.

Price: Free

### 2. Making Strategies:

Being the root of the company, it's up to the CEO to take all the big decisions regarding the company. Having an entire team to get ideas and brainstorming, a CEO might have many inflows of the ideas but not every idea is worth it or key points from multiple ideas leads us to a strong strategy and that's where noting and making to-do lists come handy, where you can jot down all the incoming ideas and then filter them out according to the needs of the company.

* [Evernote](https://evernote.com): Need to note something? Calm down, find a pen and a paper. What? The pen is not working? Hurry up, the idea might be slipping out. And by the time you find a p working pen, the idea is far gone. That's why we recommend Evernote, the all in one journaling app. You can note down whatever you want, whenever you want. The app has a very pleasing look and comes with features like to-do list created and security check-in so that your ideas remain to yourself.

Alternative: Google Keep.

### 3. Managing Workflow

Working from home is a different thing and not working at all is different.
